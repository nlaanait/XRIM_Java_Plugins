# XRIM_Java_Plugins
Suite of Java-based plugins to perfome routine data operation/visualization for x-ray microscopy.  
The plugins extend the functionality of imageJ and consist of both basic and advanced image processing routines, 
signal processing and fitting, visualization, widgets for optics calculations, and data curation.  
All of the Java plugins have graphical user interfaces built upon imageJ's base classes (e.g. GenericDialog, etc...).
